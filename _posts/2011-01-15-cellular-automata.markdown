title: cellular automata!
---

Today I got bored, so I decided to make pretty pictures of the outputs of cellular automata. The code is [here](https://gist.github.com/781483).

The code was pretty simple to write (although I don't write much python so I'm sure there's a more elegant way to do this) and it's very simple to use -- just pass in the image dimensions you want out, and the [wolfram code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_code) of the 1D cellular automata you want to use. But it occured to me, that if [Rule 110](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110) is Turing complete (and apparently it is), then in a way, this is the fastest I've ever written a virtual machine! This is also probably the most inefficient, useless-virtual machine I could easily write, and in this case it happens to run on a random input, but whatever. It makes pretty pictures!

Rule 110 :

Rule 30 :

P.S. On the relocating to NYC front : I've been here a couple of weeks now. It\`s cold, but busy and cool.  Etsy is kinda awesome, both on a people front, and on a technical front (although search is more than a little broken; I have to work on that).
