title: Hello appengine
---

Just a quick note : I had initially started this blog on github pages, and written a single substantive post before forgetting about it for an extended period. I'm attempting to restart my efforts, this time deciding to move to google appengine. The static content makes it a good fit for appengine, which offers more freedom and flexibility than github pages, where I could never get latex images to work. Also, with the new home I'm also dropping the old name (now expunged).
