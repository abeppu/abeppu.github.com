title : Hadoop World, Part 2

Tomorrow I give my talk at [Hadoop World](http://www.hadoopworld.com)! [My talk](http://www.hadoopworld.com/session/data-mining-for-product-search-ranking/) is on a rather narrow topic (how to use click stream analysis to improve product search ranking), but I've tried to liven up the content by involving aliens (!) and hand-drawn slides.  My slides can be seen on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/abeppu/data-mining-forproductsearch), or you can look at an [html version right here](/slides/hw2011-talk.html). Unfortunately, they'll make relatively little sense without the actual talk to go along with them. After the event, when Cloudera posts video, I'll put up a link.
