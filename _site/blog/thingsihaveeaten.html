<p>I like food, and I like food porn (by which I mean gratuitous pictures of food, not anything involving food and sex). Rather than merely look at other people’s mouth-watering photos, I’ve decided to start taking and sharing some of my own. Also, if I’m good, I have a record of where I’ve eaten, and an incentive to explore new and interesting food.</p>

<p><em>St. Marks and 1st Ave, 23 Jan 2011</em></p>

<p>This place is small, and when I went it was empty.  The dumpings pictured are seared, juicy, and have enough umami that I wondered a bit whether there was meat involved.  Not pictured is a small arsenal of sauces (I ordered “Hot Monster” and supplemented with a rotation of black vinegar, soy, and sriracha).  For fast and cheap, it’s very good.</p>

<p>J and I had attempted to go to Fu Sushi, which is supposed to have good vegetarian sushi, but they were closed, so we wandered two doors down in the cold, and grabbed eggs at Rue B.</p>

<p><em>Houston and Allen, 21 Jan 2011</em></p>

<p>I really enjoyed this place. They have a decent selection of veggie and vegan pizzas, including gluten-free options, combined with some interesting (if somewhat weak) cocktails. The atmosphere was quiet enough to talk, but lively enough that J and I didn’t feel guilty geeking out about under which conditions a restaurant-exploring agent should favor “exploration” and under which he should favor “exploitation”.</p>

<p><em>St. Mark’s and 2nd Ave, 20 Jan 2011</em></p>

<p>A foursquare tip said that the veggie sandwich here should be a contender for best in the city. It was good, but I hope it’s not true that this is among the best.  I still haven’t found a veggie sandwich I love here as much as the ones I used to eat regularly in Palo Alto.</p>

<p>This one is butternut squash lasagna with watercress and radicchio salad:</p>

<p>After hearing that this was the best Thai place in NYC (and after tasting Thai food in Manhattan that didn’t measure up to the Bay Area places I’ve had over the past several years), J. and I went out to Queens to see what all the fuss was about. I haven’t been around enough to back up the “best in New York” claims that get thrown around, but I’m definitely coming back</p>

<p>Crisy watercress “salad”:</p>

<p><em>Allen and Stanton, 16 Jan 2011</em></p>

<p>We had to wait a while to get a table, but it was very much worth the wait. Admittedly, the risotto was a bit undercooked, but that didn’t stop me from eating every last bite.</p>
