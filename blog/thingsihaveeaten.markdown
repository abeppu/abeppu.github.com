# Things I have eaten

I like food, and I like food porn (by which I mean gratuitous pictures of food, not anything involving food and sex). Rather than merely look at other people's mouth-watering photos, I've decided to start taking and sharing some of my own. Also, if I'm good, I have a record of where I've eaten, and an incentive to explore new and interesting food.

## Westville East

## Dumpling Man

*St. Marks and 1st Ave, 23 Jan 2011*

This place is small, and when I went it was empty.  The dumpings pictured are seared, juicy, and have enough umami that I wondered a bit whether there was meat involved.  Not pictured is a small arsenal of sauces (I ordered "Hot Monster" and supplemented with a rotation of black vinegar, soy, and sriracha).  For fast and cheap, it's very good.

## Rue B

*12th St. and Ave B, 23 Jan 2011*

J and I had attempted to go to Fu Sushi, which is supposed to have good vegetarian sushi, but they were closed, so we wandered two doors down in the cold, and grabbed eggs at Rue B.

Egg sandwich with mixed greens:

## Curry-Ya

*10th St. and 2nd Ave, 22 Jan 2011*

Veggie curry (raw egg and rice not pictured):

## Pala	    

*Houston and Allen, 21 Jan 2011*

I really enjoyed this place. They have a decent selection of veggie and vegan pizzas, including gluten-free options, combined with some interesting (if somewhat weak) cocktails. The atmosphere was quiet enough to talk, but lively enough that J and I didn't feel guilty geeking out about under which conditions a restaurant-exploring agent should favor "exploration" and under which he should favor "exploitation".

Limoncello and balsamic cocktails :

## Baoguette

*St. Mark's and 2nd Ave, 20 Jan 2011*

A foursquare tip said that the veggie sandwich here should be a contender for best in the city. It was good, but I hope it's not true that this is among the best.  I still haven't found a veggie sandwich I love here as much as the ones I used to eat regularly in Palo Alto.

Veggie Bao :

"Fresh" unfiltered jasmine tea ginger ale. The only soda I've ever seen that came with a by-line, and ginger pulp:

## Bhakti Cafe

*2nd and 1st Ave, 19 Jan 2011*

This place has vegetarian, vegan and raw food, plus wifi, and a block from my house. I'm guessing I'll be back soon.

Spinach pate raw sandwich:

## B & H Dairy

*9st and 2nd Ave, 18 Jan 2011*

Cheap, filling, and vegetarian friendly.  What's not to like?

Mushroom barley soup with challah:

## Eatsy

*Etsy HQ, 18 Jan 2011*

Etsy has some awesome people make and serve lunch twice a week.  

This one is butternut squash lasagna with watercress and radicchio salad:

![butternut squash lasagna w/ watercress and radicchio salad](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5046/5368452431_53099feb4d.jpg "the salad was good, but the butternut squash was incredible!")

## Sripraphai

*65th St and 39th Ave Queens, 17 Jan 2011*

After hearing that this was the best Thai place in NYC (and after tasting Thai food in Manhattan that didn't measure up to the Bay Area places I've had over the past several years), J. and I went out to Queens to see what all the fuss was about. I haven't been around enough to back up the "best in New York" claims that get thrown around, but I'm definitely coming back

Crisy watercress "salad":

![crispy watercress salad](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5241/5369061660_821747b88c.jpg "I know it doesn't look like a salad. But it's amazing!")

Tom Kha:

Sauteed mushrooms with tofu :

## Meatball Shop

*Allen and Stanton, 16 Jan 2011*

We had to wait a while to get a table, but it was very much worth the wait. Admittedly, the risotto was a bit undercooked, but that didn't stop me from eating every last bite.

Veggie balls in Parmesan sauce:

Oatmeal ice cream and peanut butter cookie sandwich:

## Lil' Frankie's 

*1st Ave at 2nd st, 15 Jan 2011*

This sandwich was good, but the service was really slow, and somewhat rude when we were there.

Radicchio and arugula pizza sandwich:

## Itzocan Cafe

*Ave A at E 9th St, 14 Jan 2011*

We ate at this place after two other places turned us away with 45 minute waits. The food was damn good.

Goat cheese and herb "ravioli" :

Napoleonic tower with a risotto base, a vinegar and tomato concotion at the top, and vegetable layers whose details I don't recall in the middle. Served with a pepper stuffed with mashed potato :
