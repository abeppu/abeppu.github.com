## About Me

I'm a software engineer. My primary focus has been search, and how search can be measured, understood and improved using analysis of large amounts of click stream data (primarily in Hadoop). I'm also interested in data mining and machine learning more broadly, and sometimes dabble in data visualization (I have a code crush on [Mike Bostock](http://github.com/mbostock)). Presently, I work for [Etsy.com](http://etsy.com) on their search team. From June 2008 through December 2010 I worked for the [A9.com](http://a9.com/) in Palo Alto. Prior to that, I studied cognitive science (with particular attention to computational models) at UC Berkeley.

When not messing with data, I enjoy producing and consuming vegetarian food, pictures of vegetarian food, and struggling to play the piano and guitar.
