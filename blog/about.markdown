## About Me

I'm an ML and software engineer based in San Francisco, CA.
I have primarily worked use ML to efficiently and reliably solve boring business problems. This has included automating document-centered business processes, and detecting/stopping fraud and other malicious behavior.

I am also interested in tools and techniques for large-scale distributed data processing.

When not messing with data, I enjoy producing and consuming vegetarian food, and struggling to play the piano and guitar.
