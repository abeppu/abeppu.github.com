## About Me

I'm a software engineer.  After graduating from Berkeley in 2008, I went to work for a couple of years with the Search Analytics team at [A9.com](http://a9.com/) in Palo Alto. Recently (the start of 2011) I began working on the search team at [Etsy.com](http://etsy.com).

Online, I can be found at the following :
